I made this because I was always forgetting where my lectures were 

### Description
This is an Android application which (for now) shows my university timetable and which lecture should I be in at the moment.

#### Features
The main screen of the app shows the days of the week, the current day being highlighted. 
Pressing on one of them shows the corresponding timetable, where the current time interval is highlighted and pressing on a lecture shows the location of it.

### Future updates
I am planning on making the app read the timetable from an external file.
A nice feature would also be to implement an interface for editing the timetable inside the app.
